The purpose of the README file is to list and describe all files that were used for the Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

Data file for the project:
  
- Title: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
- Data File Name: UCI HAR Dataset
- Link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Files:

- codebook.md: A code book that describes the procedure of getting and cleaning data, the variables, and the data.

- run_analysis.R: The purpose of this script is to collect, work with, and clean a data set that can be used for later analysis by performing the following steps:
     1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
     4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- tidy.txt: The submitted data set exported from this script for the project.
